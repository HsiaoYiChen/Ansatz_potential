This is an example code for Gd2PdSi3.
A general code for different material is under development.

Before using the code, you need first recomplie your quantum espresso with the patch in the PP folder.

How to use them:
1. use the make_random.f90 to create a bash script: run.sh
2. activate  run.sh to create folders of different spin configuration.
3. do QE scf calculation in all the folders
4. use R_sym.f90 to create the index mapping and symmetry operation
5. activate run_extract.sh to collect the result from scf calculation after symmetry treatment.
6. use fit.f90 to fit the ansatz potential
7. examine the result with plt_compare.f90
